1.Cross-browser testing is the process of testing our website 
  on different browsers and operating systems.
  
2.Since the engine is different, the way a browser understands
 the web languages (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) is different.
 
 Example : So, the position property of  CSS would run fine 
           on Chrome but will choke on Safari because of the absence of -WebKit tag.

3. Cross - Browser Testing in TestNG:
	
	Cross-browser testing using TestNG ensure a better 
	performance on different browsers and OS.
	
	One can track Font-size issues.
	
	The unsupported tags can be revealed, which can be 
	taken care of by turnaround codes.
	
	Image orientations mess up a lot of the time. 
	We can take care of it.
	
	The tester and the developer can assure how JavaScript
    renders on different browsers.
