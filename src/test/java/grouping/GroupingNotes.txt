1.TestNG groups combine the tests into groups and let the tester 
  choose which ones to run and which ones to ignore. 

2.Grouping the Test in Testing.

3. In a single project we can create more than one xml file.

4.It is important to note that Groups are declared in the
  testng.xml file in the TestNG and can be found inside <test> tag or <suite> tag.
  
5.Also, remember that the groups defined in <test> tag apply to only that particular 
  test tag, but the groups defined in <suite> tag apply to all the <test> tags in the XML file.
